In this project, I will be doing Exploratory data analysis for the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority datasets in New York. I plan to study the crowded stations and when the 
traffic occurs, and we can use this information to add more food trucks and booths to these stations 
and help the people to find without waiting for long time. Also, we can provide transportation 
facilities like bikes and more taxis in traffic times. To help the shops in less crowded stations, we 
can plan for events and carnivals to increase the number of visitors in these stations which will 
increase the sales.
